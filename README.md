## File System

Functions description:
- **freeSystem**() frees the whole graph in a depth first manner, recursively
- **tabPrinter**() prints spaces for the tree() function
- **root**() initializes the root directory
- **parser**() parses the input instructions, splitting them into 3 strings: *command, arg1 and arg2*
- the rest of the functions do exactly what they are supposed to do in the tasks, with no extra features, so no point in describing them further (comments are provided)
